# EPFL: Image Analysis and Pattern Recognition Labs
The objective of this course is to learn and practice the basic methods of digital image analysis and pattern recognition: pre-processing, image segmentation, shape representation and classification

The course involves three lab sessions and a final capstone project. Concepts are illustrated by applications in computer vision and medical image analysis.

# Lab Descriptions

### Lab 1: Image Segmentation: 
This lab is composed of two parts:
	1- Brain tissue segmentation using a variety of region and contour based segmentation methods such as region growing, region splitting and merging, contour detection + binary region growing
	2- Shape/color segmentation: counting the number of shapes of each color and computing the total area (in pixels) of each color.


### Lab 2: Object description: 
This lab is composed of two parts:
	1- Description of handwritten 0&1 using Fourier descriptors, PCA, t-SNE, Chamfer Distance and many other methods
	2- Applying the same methods (a few key methods among them) to handwritten 0/1/2/3 to demonstrate how they perform for a larger number of different classes

### Lab 3: Classification: 
Applying various classification methods such as Bayes method, KNN, MLP, CNN on data sets of three classes scattered on 2D space.
The notebook for this lab will be added after its grade is announced.
